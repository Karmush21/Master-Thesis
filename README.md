# **Master-Thesis**  

Official code for my master's thesis titled:  
**"Exploring Deep Learning Frameworks for Segmentation of the Left Ventricular Myocardium from 4D Cardiac Computed Tomography: Investigating Hybrid Approaches for Combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers"**  

This is one of those projects where I keep telling myself that Iâ€™ll finish by setting up a proper repository, but I always end up postponing it due to other commitments. Now is no exception. So, my apologies for the repository not being the cleanest. 

If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to contact me at **anmar.karmush@liu.se**.
