This is one of those projects where I keep telling myself that Iâ€™ll finish by setting up a proper repository, but I always end up postponing it due to other commitments. Now is no exception. So, my apologies for the repository not being the cleanest.

The main script is `TRUNet/trunet_main.py`, which is where you're also change the necessary pathways to your data. 


If you have any questions at all about the code, please feel free to contact me at **anmar.karmush@liu.se**.
