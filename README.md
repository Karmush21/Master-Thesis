# **Master-Thesis**  

Official code for my **master's thesis** titled:  
**"Exploring Deep Learning Frameworks for Segmentation of the Left Ventricular Myocardium from 4D Cardiac Computed Tomography: Investigating Hybrid Approaches for Combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers"**  

This is one of those projects that I keep pushing updates to frequently (and now is no exception), so **my apologies** for the repository not being the cleanest.  

If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to contact me at **anmar.karmush@liu.se**.
